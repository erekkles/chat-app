# chat-app

This is a practice project in which I make use of node.js in the backend and socket.io both in front and backend to create a websocket based chat application.

Tools used in the development of this project:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Socket.io
* Cors (npm package)
* Nodemon
* Heroku
* Netlify 


## Features

Just for reference, I will list out the features of this application:
* Typing status (user is typing...)
* Private messages between connected clients (Write the message, then click the username of the receiver).
* Global messages between all connected clients.
* Notification for new connections.
* Notification for new disconnections.


## Demo

To fully test out this application, it is recommended to try it with a partner/friend. If not possible however, you can open 2 tabs simultaneously to simulate 2 clients.
